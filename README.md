GOD’S EYE – AI-Powered Oil Spill Detection

This project aims to develop an AI-driven system that detects oil spills in marine environments using AIS data and satellite imagery. It employs ML models for anomaly detection in vessel behavior and DeepLabV3 for oil spill segmentation from SAR images. The system enables real-time monitoring, reduces environmental impact, and enhances maritime safety by automating detection and response. Scalable and easily integrable, it supports efficient spill mitigation and regulatory compliance.
